## Weapons
### starting weapons:
- broken sword (medium damage, low yield of seeds) - default found in starting chest
- sycthe (low damage, high yield of seeds) - default found in starting chest
- axe (high damage, slow attack, low yield of seeds) - found in bottom left corner of connector map or city, implied theft, more expensive axe being sold in village, get in trouble later down the line if stolen. Maybe old man threatens to report theft
- pickaxe (medium damage, can mine rocks?, no yield of seeds) (what would be in the rocks? gold? money? minerals, traded for money?) found in village? maybe first dungeon/mine player enters?
- magic sword (high damage, regular attack, no yield of seeds) given by old man when accepting the quest

### expanding on pickaxe:
maybe it can be found in the first mine the player enters, or can be bought in the village (very expensive). Make mines semi rare but rich in minerals, overworld rocks being less valuable than mine minerals
Need to be careful though, don't want to make money too important. Players might have assumption that money is important, make sure to re-enforce that it's mostly a waste of time and not worth the grind.

only one weapon can be carried at a time? hmm... might be annoying for players. maybe they can carry more than one in static levels but can only bring one in forest. maybe limit inventory so much that bringing multiple weapons is not worth it.

## Shops

### Overview
There are shops in the city to buy seeds and equipment. Everything is way too expensive to re-enforce the idea of foraging and scavenging to the player. Shop owners are mean to you because they know you don't have money/have stolen before. 

### Theft
General theft mechanic in shops, if get caught get thrown in jail for a day, or escape. but can't access shops as easily after that. more expensive stuff harder to steal. 

## Pets
idle animation with cat or dog. cat jumps on shoulder/head, rubs face on legs. dog falls asleep next to legs/rolls over/ZOOMIES. just pets. purr sound effect with cats
